# AudioMass - Electron

> The original project is amazing and I should follow the updates from there

- The original project from the talented developper can be found [here](https://github.com/pkalogiros/AudioMass)
- I've changed nothing but the way it runs by using electron (no need to use a webserver)


## Install & run

- `npm install` && `npm start`

##Â What could be improved (acccording to me)

- the ability to draw volume / pan automation
- export (using embeded ffmpeg ?)
